Introduction
------------
TaskManagement is a vim plugin that uses GTD-like philosophy to let you manage tasks through vim. It is dependent on a schema I created to `manage my tasks <http://ifacethoughts.net/2008/05/11/task-management-using-vim/>`_.

I wanted to keep this is as a .vimrc script so that you can easily modify it as per your need. However, plugins and changes to these plugins are easier to manage than loose scripts. Hence this attempt.

I will still encourage you glance over the code and make changes as per your need.

How to install
--------------
This plugin has a syntax file along with the functionality code. Install ``plugin/taskmanagement.vim`` in your vim plugins directory (e.g., .vim/plugin on Linux) and ``syntax/taskmanagement.vim`` in your vim syntax directory (e.g., .vim/syntax on Linux).

You can set the environment variable ``VIMTASKMANAGEMENTDIR` to point to the directory where these task files will be stored. If not explicitly set, it assumes the location to be ``~/wiki/``.

How to use
----------
I have to put in details of usage here. Till then read `my blog post about this <http://ifacethoughts.net/2008/05/11/task-management-using-vim/>`_.

Other than the commands mentioned there, you can also use the command ``Pending`` to get a list of tasks not done in last 7 days.

Troubleshooting
---------------
The plugin depends on ``strftime()`` function. It will prompt you a message if your platform does not support ``strftime()``. Please contact me at ``abhijit@ifacethoughts.net`` in case you come across other errors.
